In this document we propose 2 sample designs to assess the accuracy of the 
MAD-Mex 2015 RapidEye (1:20,000) map. 

## Sampling design 1

### Objectives
* Estimate the overall accuracy of polygons correctly classified. 

* Estimate the accuracy of polygons correctly classified within each 
state-class.


### Design
One-stage stratified sampling: we independently take a Simple Random Sample 
from each stratum, so that $n_h$ observations are randomly selected from the
$N_h$ poulation units in stratum $h$.

**Observation Units (spatial assessment unit):** Map polygons, the area within
each polygon has the same map classification, assigned by Madmex. The map is the 
result of an aggregation from madmex *homogeneous* segments (yielding 40m 
polygons per scene).

**Sampling frame:** Set of polygons.  

**Stata:** State (32)$\times$Classes (not every class is reported on every state).

**Reference data**: RapidEye images 2015, this are the same images that were
input for the classification.

**Reference labeling protocol**: Experts will asign a single reference label to 
each polygon, if a given polygon is not homogeneous the will assign the 
prevalent class.

**Agreement:** For a given unit (polygon) if reference label and map label 
agree the map is correct for that unit ($y_i=1$).

### Estimators
For the overall accuracy (proportion of polygos correctly classified) we propose 
the estimator $\hat{p}_{str}$:

$$\hat{p}_{str}=\sum_{h\in H}\frac{N_h}{N}\hat{p}_h$$
where $H$ is the number of strata, $N_h$ is the number of polygons in the $h$th
stratum, $N$ is the total number of polygons and $\hat{p_h}$ is the proportion 
of polygons correctly classified in stratum $h$.

The variance of $\hat{p}_{str}$:

$$Var(\hat{p}_{str})=\sum_{h\in H}(1-f_h)\bigg(\frac{N_h}{N}\bigg)^2\frac{s_h^2}{n_h}$$
where $s_h^2=\frac{n_h}{n_h-1}\hat{p_h}(1-\hat{p_h})$, thus:

$$Var(\hat{p}_{str})=\sum_{h\in H}(1-f_h)\bigg(\frac{N_h}{N}\bigg)^2\frac{\hat{p_h}(1-\hat{p_h})}{n_h-1}$$
where $n_h$ is the sample size in the $h$th stratum. 

## Sample size computation
To decide how many polygons to sample from each stratum we must consider the
objectives of the accuracy assessment and make certain assumptions.

Regarding the estimation of the overall accuracy we can go with **Neyman 
allocation**: assuming that the direct cost to sample an individual element is 
equal across strata, then the most precision for the least cost is achieved 
setting sample sizes as follows:

$$n_h= n\frac{N_hS_h}{\Sigma N_iS_i}$$

If we also assume that the variance is equal across strata then the optimal 
allocation is **proportional allocation**: the number of sampled units in each 
stratum is proportional to the size of the stratum.

$$\frac{n_h}{N_h}=\frac{n}{N} $$

If we take into account that we are interested in estimating the accuracy for
each cover-class in each state, then we can specify the precision within strata.
If the desired precision is expressed in absolute terms, as 

$$P(|\hat{p}-p|\le e)=1-\alpha$$
For many surveys in which a proportion is measured, we set the margin of error 
$e = 0.03$ and $\alpha=0.05$.

$$n=\frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2S^2}{e^2+z_{\alpha/2}^2S^2/N}$$

In surveys in which the response of interest is a proportion $S^2\approx p(1-p)$
which attains its maximal value when $p=1/2$, so using 

$$n_0=1.96^2/4e^2$$

will result in a 95\% CI with width at most $2e$.

e    |  n
-----|-----
0.01 |9600
0.03 |1000
0.05 |400
0.07 |200
0.10 |100

Results from Mad-Mex RE 2011 indicate accuracy (user's accuracy) varies from 
class to class from $p=0.2$ to $p=0.8$, hence for $e = 0.03$ we have

p    |  n
-----|----
0.2  |680
0.3  |900
0.4  |1000
0.5  |1070

### Compromise
We propose a compromise between propotional allocation and a desired 
precision within strata. We also need to take into account that $S^2$, 
the variance within strata is unkown, thus we could use 2011 estimates to 
approximate $S^2$ and use Neyman allocation. 

An alternative is to use 1/4 as an upper bound for $S^2$ and use a compromise between 
proportional allocation and sufficient sample size within strata. For example, 
if proportional allocation results in a sample size $n_h \le 100$ then set 
$n_h=100$, the minimum sample size within strata will depend on which is an 
acceptable margin of error for each class within a state, if the minimum is 
$50$, we get a margin of approximately $0.14$.

### Example: Yucatan

Proportional allocation for $n=200, 500,1000,1500`$:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
N <- nrow(fc_data)
sample_prop <- fc_data %>%
    group_by(interpreta) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(
        N_h = n(), 
        prop_size_h = round(100 * N_h / N), 
        n_200 = round(prop_size_h * 2),
        n_500 = round(prop_size_h * 5),
        n_1000 = round(prop_size_h * 10), 
        n_1500 = round(prop_size_h * 15)) %>%
    arrange(desc(N_h)) %>%
    select(cover_class = interpreta, N_h:n_1500)
sample_prop
```

We notice that there are strata with very small sample sizes. We can increase 
sample to have a minimum size of 30 polygons per strata. Then using 1/4 as an
upper bound for $S^2$ we get the standard errors we can expect for the overall
accuracy under the different schemes, and the final sample sizes:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sample_long <- gather(sample_prop, sample_size, n_h, n_200:n_1500)

sample_long %>%
    dplyr::mutate(n_h = ifelse(n_h < 30, 30, n_h)) %>%
    group_by(sample_size) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(
        n = sum(n_h), 
        se_p = round(sqrt(
            sum((1 - n_h / N_h) * (N_h / N) ^ 2 * 0.25 / (n_h - 1))), 2)
        ) %>%
    arrange(n) %>%
    select(initial_n=sample_size, n, se_p)
```


## Sampling design 2

We noticed that polygons differ hugely in size. The next plot (in log 10 scale) 
shows the area of polygons across classes for the polygons in Yucatan, the 
smallest polygons are less than 1 m^2^ and the largest ones over 500,000 m^2, it 
is also clear that the distribution of area has long tails. Thus, using the 
percentage of polygons correctly classified might not be very meaningful. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, width=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(fc_data, aes(y = area_sp, x = factor(interpreta), group = interpreta)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_y_log10() +
    labs(title = "Polygon's area", y = bquote(m^2), x = "assigned class")
```

Therefore, we propose as metric of accuracy an estimate of the proportion of area correctly 
classified, moreover it is a concearn among the team that the classification of 
smaller pixels might tend to be less accurate than larger ones, we thus include 
the area of the polygon (categorized) as a variable for stratification.

### Objectives
* Estimate the proportion of area correctly classified. 

* Estimate the proportion of area correctly classified within each state-class.

## Formulas
The overall proportion of area correctly classified is:

$$p = \sum_{h=1}^H \frac{M_h}{M_0}p_h$$
Where $M_h$ is the area of the $hth$ strata, $M_0=\sum M_h$ is the total area
of Mexico, and $p_h$ is the accuracy within strata.

An estimator for $p$ is:

$$\hat{p} = \sum_{h=1}^H \frac{M_h}{M_0}\hat{p}_h$$

with standard error:

$$SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^H\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M_h}{M_0}\bigg)^2\frac{s_h^2}{n_h}}$$
where $s_h^2$ is the estimate of the population variance in stratum $h$.

The population quantity $p_h$ can be computed as follows:

$$p_h = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_h} M_{hi} y_{hi}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_h} M_{hi}}$$
The estimator of $p_h$ is:

$$\hat{p}_h = \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi} y_{hi}}{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}}$$
where $M_{hi}$ is the size of the $ith$ polygon in strata $h$ and $y_{hi}$ 
indicates whether the $ith$ polygon was correctly classified (takes values $1$ or $0$). 

with standard error:
$$SE(\hat{p}_h) = \sqrt{\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\frac{1}{n_h\bar{M_h}^2} \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}^2(y_{hi}-\hat{p}_h)^2}{n_h-1}}$$
where $n_h$ is the sample size in strata $h$, $N_h$ is the population size (number
of polygons) in strata $h$, and $\bar{M_h}$ is the average area of the polygons in
the sample.

And we have that the variance for the overall accuracy is:
$$SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^H\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M_h}{M_0}\bigg)^2\frac{1}{n_h \bar{M_h}^2} \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}^2(y_{hi}-\hat{p}_h)^2}{n_h-1}}$$

The ratio estimator is biased, thus we should consider a *corrected* version or 
use an unbiased estimator (the latter might result in increased variance).

## Sample allocation
The sample allocation is an optimization problem, we want minimum variance 
suject to constraints:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{n_h}{\text{min}}
& & \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^H\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M_h}{M_0}\bigg)^2\frac{S_h^2}{n_h}} \\ \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \sum_{h=1}^H n_h = n, \\
& & & n_h \geq c_1, \; h = 1, \ldots, H, \\
& & & n_{e,c} \geq c_2, \; class = 1,\ldots,32. 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
Where $n_h$ is the sample size in stratum $h$ and $n_{e,c}$ is the sample class for
cover class $c$ in state $e$. 

Thus we seek to minimize the variance of the estimate of the overall 
accuracy $\_hat{p}$, subject to the constraints: 

* We minimize subject to a given sample size $n$ (otherwise we would just select
every polygon).

* $n_h \geq c_1$, we set a minimum size per strata in order to be able 
to estimate the variance within strata (the minimum required for variance estimation
would be $n_h=2$), however, when setting $c_1$ we should also consider that if 
we are going to use a ratio estimator (within strata) the order of the bias is 
$O(n_h^{-1})$.

* In addition we set a minimum sample size within each state-cover class. This 
is because we are interested in estimating the user's accuracy for each 
$state \times cover \; class$, thus if we collapse the original strata 
($state \times cover \; class \times size \; class$) to get a partition by 
$state \times cover \; class$, and we set a minimum sample size, in order to 
attain an acceptable estimate.

* It is worth noting that the optimization problem was set in terms of minimum
variance; however, we are using a biased estimator and it is more 
appropriate to minimize the Mean Squared Error.

### MSE 

Let $w_i=M_iy_i$, then (we drop the $h$ subindex to avoid clutter):

$$\hat{p}=\frac{\sum_{i \in S} M_{i} y_{i}}{\sum_{i \in S} M_{i}}=\frac{\sum_{i \in S} w_{i}}{\sum_{i \in S} M_{i}}$$
and we have that:

$$MSE(\hat{p}) \approx \bigg(1-\frac{n}{N}\bigg)\frac{S_w^2-2BRS_wS_M+p^2S_M^2}{n\bar{M_U^2}}$$
where $R$ is the correlation between $w$ and $M$, $S_w$ and $S_M$ are the standard
deviations, $B$ is the true proportion, and $\bar{M_U^2}$ is the average polygon
size (population value).

The bias 

$$Bias(\hat{p})\approx \bigg(1-\frac{n}{N}\bigg)\frac{1}{n\bar{M}^2}(BS_M^2-RS_MS_y)$$
