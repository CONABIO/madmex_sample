## Formulas
The overall proportion of area correctly classified is:

$$p = \sum_{h=1}^H \frac{M_h}{M_0}p_h$$
Where $M_h$ is the area of the $hth$ strata, $M_0=\sum M_h$ is the total area
of Mexico, and $p_h$ is the accuracy within strata.

An estimator for $p$ is:

$$\hat{p} = \sum_{h=1}^H \frac{M_h}{M_0}\hat{p}_h$$

with standard error:

$$SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^H\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M_h}{M_0}\bigg)^2\frac{s_h^2}{n_h}}$$
where $s_h^2$ is the estimate of the population variance in stratum $h$.

The population quantity $p_h$ can be computed as follows:

$$p_h = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_h} M_{hi} y_{hi}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_h} M_{hi}}$$
The estimator of $p_h$ is:

$$\hat{p}_h = \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi} y_{hi}}{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}}$$
where $M_{hi}$ is the size of the $ith$ polygon in strata $h$ and $y_{hi}$ 
indicates whether the $ith$ polygon was correctly classified (takes values $1$ or $0$). 

with standard error:
$$SE(\hat{p}_h) = \sqrt{\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\frac{1}{n_h\bar{M_h}^2} \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}^2(y_{hi}-\hat{p}_h)^2}{n_h-1}}$$
where $n_h$ is the sample size in strata $h$, $N_h$ is the population size (number
of polygons) in strata $h$, and $\bar{M_h}$ is the average area of the polygons in
the sample.

And we have that the variance for the overall accuracy is:
$$SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\sum_{h=1}^H\bigg(1-\frac{n_h}{N_h}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M_h}{M_0}\bigg)^2\frac{1}{n_h \bar{M_h}^2} \frac{\sum_{i \in S_h} M_{hi}^2(y_{hi}-\hat{p}_h)^2}{n_h-1}}$$

The ratio estimator is biased, thus we should consider a *corrected* version or 
use an unbiased estimator (the latter might result in increased variance).


#### Combined

$$\hat{p} = \frac{\sum_h \frac{M_{h0}}{M_{h}}\sum_i M_{hi}y_{hi}}{\sum_h \frac{M_{h0}}{M_{h}} \sum_i M_{hi}}$$
